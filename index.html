            <p>Buy & Borrow is a mobile 
                application that allows users to 
                search for commonly needed 
                items that are available in their 
                local community, either to 
                purchase or to borrow from 
                another person. The goal of this 
                project was to give users fast 
                and efficient access to information 
                of where to find needed items, 
                and also to drive a sense of 
                community post-pandemic.</p>

            <p>Edgar's Mission is an 
                Australian non-for-profit 
                organisation that provides 
                care to over 400 rescued 
                farm animals. The goal of 
                this project was to improve
                the digital presence of the 
                organisation through a website 
                redesign, resulting in higher 
                donation, volunteering, and 
                visitation rates. <br><br>

            <p>The Australian Taxation Office provides service to users looking for key 
                information for thier businesses, or their own finances, and is a hub for 
                all resources to do with your tax return. The goal of this 
                project was to redefine the Information Architecture of the ATO website, 
                giving it a visual and stylistic overhaul in the process.

            <p>What started as a redesign of the 300 Blankets website, turned into 
                an idea to kickstart people's volunteering work through education 
                and connections with others. The goal of this project was to aid 
                users who were looking to volunteer for causes they believe in, but 
                were unsure what the best ways to help are, and where to find information.

        <div class="will-info">
            <p>I completed the Bachelor of Digital Media at Griffith University, 
                before moving on to study UX/UI Design at Monash University. I enjoy creating 
                responsive designs for web and mobile that not only help solve the users needs, 
                but also intrigue the user through interesting use of style and animation. 
                <br><br>
                Aside from design, I enjoy writing and story-telling, particularly in video games. 
                My podcast, The Rumble Pack, takes a deep dive into the character motiviations and 
                story beats of some of the most famous games to release.
                <br><br>
                I am an avid music lover, and drummer of 10+ years.

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p class="skills-info">To approach user research I begin with a proto persona. I want to
                understand the user the best way I can. Beginning with a leading statement, 
                I tend to form an initial hypothesis, and use it alongside my persona to 
                craft the best possible research path that will solve user needs. Initial
                work is carried outthrough Miro boards, and pen and paper.</p>
            <h2>Qualitative Interviews</h2>
            <p class="skills-info">Qualitative interviews are so important to the UX 
                phase, and coming with the right questions in crucial. I like to ask leading questions 
                where I can, and really allow the interviewee time to think and describe why 
                their answer is important to their life. Creating a script that targets my persona is 
                also very crucial, and I work to make sure everything I found out during an 
                interview will be valuable in either validating, or in-validating my initial thoughts.</p>
            <h2>User Empathy</h2>
            <p class="skills-info">When I empathise with users, I try to see a 
                problem from their perspective. Drawing from problem statements
                and other key insights, helps to understand not only if a user needs a 
                certain problem solved, but why they need it solved. I like to spend a 
                lot of time in the empathy phase of UX design, so the end result can be as 
                tailored to the user as possible.</p>
