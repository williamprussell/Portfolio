            <h1 class="title">About the Project</h1>
            <p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) plays a large role in the Australian economy. The ATO's role is to effectively manage and shape the tax 
                and superannuation systems to support and fund services for Australians. The goal of this project is to perform a redesign of the ATO's website, 
                ensuring that users are treated to a managable site structure and pleasent viewing experience.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title-h2">The Idea</h2>
            <p>By first understanding the target audience, I was able to restructure the website's navigation and build new information architecture that directly 
                enhanced the experience for the user, relieving potential pain points.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title-h2">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The ATO is used by Australians from many different backgrounds and ideaologies, so choices had to be made to suit many types of people. The ATO is a 
                government agency and it sometimes felt limiting to implement a specific style system.

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>
                Beginning with a choice of different govermnent agencies to redesign, I chose to redesign the ATO website after feeling 
                there was a distinct lack of style present. I wanted to re-imagine the colour system and streamline the main navigation options 
                for the user, as the website contains an extremely large amount of buttons and links. Of course, a website/agency such as this is 
                home to a mountain of information, so this is to be expected. Hence, my desire to try and simplify it for the user.
                 <br><br>
                 My method was to first understand what the user looks like and their goals on the website. Next, I defined what works on the 
                 current ATO website and what needs to change. Through detailed information architecture, I planned the navigation system and then finally, I spent 
                 time wireframing and prototyping at different levels of fidelity, iterating along the way.

            <h2>Proto Persona</h2>
            <p>
                I started by creating a proto persona named Oswald. Oswald is a 32 year old marketing manager, who is looking to manage his income in 
                a stress free manner. He feels frustrated when his time is wasted using government websites such as the ATO, and does not enjoy tax time 
                because of the time waste and confusion it brings.

            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <p>Next, I ran five user tests of the current ATO website, gaining some mixed results in the process.
                <Br><br>
                Users were given 5 tasks to perform across the website and asked to comment on their experience after each task, including their thoughts 
                on the overall design, gains and pain points. 
            </p>
            <h2>Questions to be answered</h2>
            <p> 1. How <b>effeciently</b> can users use on-screen links to find their needed page/information? <br>
                2. What stops the user from successfully arriving at their destination?<br>
                3. What components present pain points for the user?<br>
                4. At what point during the website flow can users get stuck?<br>

        <div class="interview-content">
            <h2>Interview Findings</h2>
            <p>Testers were concerned with the information they desire not being easily accessible, as information spread across the site through the 
                main navigation and sub navigation between pages felt "misleading" and "too broad". The sheer amount of information presented from the home page 
                was overwhelming for the users, and headers felt hard to use based on the information desired.
                <br><br>
                Users commented that the footer was very hard to use, with the amount of links presented feeling like a "wall of text", and some calling for it 
                to be "simplified".
                <br><br>
                I created a prioritisation matrix to organise the responses and understand what would be the most important to the user, and the government agency.
                <br><Br>
                    I decided the most usable parts of the tests were the text being accessable and clear and relevant information being present.

            <h1>Define</h1>
            <p>
                After user testing, I wanted to dive into the ATO website to gain insight of where any problems may lie, and where I could make a real difference. I started 
                with redlined annotation of some of the most used pages, including the home, individuals, tax return and what's new pages. I discovered issues with categorisation, 
                hierarchy, and the general ordering/flow. Calling back to LATCH principles, I sited many hard to understand sections present where headers and links did not follow 
                any set principles, leaving them to feel out of order and confusing.
                <br><br>
                To dive deeper I defined certain user paths through the website, which all involved a high number of clicks and plenty of text to read through. In the flow below, the user 
                is looking to gain information on the Tax Free Threshold, and they find it through various pages using multiple navigations (top and side), and on page links. I felt this was too 
                many clicks for the user to easily find the information they were after, which was backed up in my user testing sessions.

        <div class="insights">
            <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
            <p>Tash needs to donate to non-for-profit charities, because doing so will keep important causes running so she can feel at 
                ease about her beliefs.<br><br>
                
                During our research, we discovered people are more likely to donate to non-for-profit organisations that are honest, 
                realiable, and have a well established online presence.<Br><br>

                We believe if more information is accessible at the right place for non-profit organisations and charities, the more 
                people and animals can relief and receive assistance.<br><br>

                Therefore, we believe that redesigning the Edgar's Mission website to improve booking functions for volunteering and 
                visits, donation pages, and style, will help users efficiently discover ways to engage with the Mission, and therefore be more likely to raise more awareness as a result.

            <p>To begin our ideation phase we set out to define where the importance lies within the website, and what journeys our users will be 
                taking within. 
                <br><br>
                We began with a <b>Site Analysis</b> of the Edgar's Mission website.
                <br><br>
                We discovered that while the website had clear information available, you had to dig for it. The site navigation was very unclear to users and 
                there was no sense of specific information architecture to aid users at all. The site was in desperate need of a visual overhaul, with no clear style direction 
                in terms of font type or size, and colour distribution. 
            </p>

            <p>Our <b>Competitor Analysis</b> showed that many websites were struggling to find the right balance of stylish visuals and engaging content. 
                All sites by Animals Australia had varying sizes of text, and 50% of sites lacked the clear information that users desire.<Br><br>
                It was clear that we needed to focus on creating a design system that commited to a bold style, with clear navigation and information key focuses also.

        <div class="feature-prior"></div>
        <div class="ideation-3">
            <p>We felt it was important to understand which features would create an impactful experience for the user, so we created this <b>Feature Prioritisation</b> 
                matrix.
                <br><br>
                We belived that key features to focus on would be the donation and volunteering portals, visuals and making the site mobile friendly.

        <div class="ideation-4">
            <p>This <b>User Journey Map</b> provides key information about Tash's journey through the Edgar's Mission website and describes when and why certain 
                actions will provide different emotions. With this map, we can predict at what stages of the user experience will provide gains for Tash and when will 
                potentially cause any pain points. 
                <br><br>
                Using the map, we believe that there is oppurtunity to enhance the user experience by providing tools to the user when necessary.

            <h1>The Solution</h1>
            <p>The ideation phase helped us understand what next steps to take to ensure that the user experience that is being targeted will be provided. We learnt that 
                there is a lack of clear information throughout non-for-profit websites and that building strong information architecture can help provide support to users 
                trying to find the information they need.
                <br><br>
                We believed the solution for our redesign is defined by these characteristics:
                <br><br>
                - Organised information architecture
                <br><br>
                - A style guide that tells the right story and is visually appealing
                <br><br>
                - Clear information and instruction when donating or registering to be a volunteer
                <br><Br>
                Our idea was to build user portals for the donation and volunteering streams that, while still staying on the website, served as their own small hubs of information 
                relevant to the users needs.
                <br><br>
                With our vision now clear we first built information architecture.

            <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
            <p>The current website included many navigation options from the top nav-bar and we wanted to simplify it for the user, while keeping the most important 
                aspects grouped together and still easy to find. The six navigation options below were chosen to suit user needs based on our research and also to provide 
                the most essential options for engagement, sich as donation and volunteer.
                <br><br>
                Links previously found within the top nav-bar, such as the blog, shop, and events, were now moved to the bottom of the page, being feautured on their own

                Users were given 5 navigation based tasks to fulfill during our user testing sessions. We narrowed down the test results to these key findings:
                <br><br>
                - We needed to match all graphics and typography across the website as there was a bit of misplacement
                <br><br>
                - Interactive states to be added for the portal tabs to cause less confusion
                <br><br>
                - The graphics and styling could be more welcoming
                <br><br>
                - The header banner was too large
                <br><br>
                With these iterations to be worked on, we dove straight into our high-fidelity prototype.

            <h1>High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
            <p>
                Our high-fidelity prototype was being built with two things in mind: style and substance. We needed to nail our information architecture, while producing a style system 
                that does the mission justice and is provides a pleasing experience for the user.
            </p>
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Inspiration for our style guide came from colours of the Australian landscape. While that was the inspiration, we still wanted to colours to be inviting ot the user, so the colours 
                are of a softer tone. We determined the typical use for each colour in our system, with Eucalyptus being the main colour across the website.
                <br><br>
                We settled on the use of two distinctly different yet complimentary fonts in the heavy and square font Lora complimented by the use of Nunito as softer, rounder body text which 
                is easy to read without being comical or overly soft. Our user testing yielded positive feedback regarding the use of Nunito as a body style and the use of Lora as an attention grabbing 
                headline style was well received.  

            </p>
            <div class="style-image"></div>
            <div class="style-image-2"></div>
            <h2>High-Fidelity Screens</h2>
            <p>
                Based on user testing feedback, and our completed style guide, we settled on a design that we believed fit the mission's personality and creating a pleasing experience for the 
                user. Pictures were made to look stuck down in an effort to make the website have a more home-like feel, with the idea that the website is a scrapbook. Here is the home page design:

            <div class="hifi-image"></div>
            <p>
                And here are final designs for the volunteer and donation portals:

            <div class="volunteer-image"></div>
            <div class="donate-image"></div>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h3>Adopt an Animal</h3>
            <p>
                We wanted to highlight all of the wonderful animals that live at the mission and give the users an oppurtunity to browse the animals online before they head out to meet them, or 
                even adopt them. Adopting animals was a key highlight of our intitial user research which was well recieved so it was essentially we kept it in the final design.
            <div class="training-image"></div>
            <h3>Make a Donation</h3>
            <p>
                Users can use the donation portal to donate directly to the mission using a set amount, or setting up a recurring donation. This flow was created to provide the 
                easiest experience donating to the user and we added a stepper to make sure the user understands where on the website they are at all times.
            </p>
            <div class="calendar-image"></div>
            <h3>Volunteer at the Mission</h3>
            <p>
                For the volunteering stream, we wanted to focus on providing the user with a tool that gives chance to better time management and oppurtunity. Using the portal, users can 
                check upcoming events at the mission, read mail and newsletters, and create their own profile so the mission and others in the community easily can identify them.
            </p>
            <div class="connect-image"></div>
            <h3>Visit the Farm</h3>
            <p>
                In a similar fashion to the volunteering portal, we wanted to make sure users could easily understand when visits were available, and be able to best find a time to visit that 
                both accomodates themselves, and the mission.
            </p>

            <h1>Mobile Designs</h1>
            <p>As stated in our feature priorisation matrix, we wanted to make sure we came up with a mobile friendly design. While our focus for this project was largely the website redesign, we 
                made sure to create some high-fidelity mobile screens to display responsiveness, and show a glimpse into the future of the website.

                This project was extremely rewarding and gave all of us confidence in our design skills moving forward. We learnt a lot about teamwork and how to best communicate with others in the 
                design space. I learnt the importance of a strong style guide and system, as websites filled with lots of different types of variation need consistency in the design to properly get 
                across to the user. This website features multiple flows and without a consistent design system, it would simply be too overwhelming for the user. And finally, I believe this project 
                helped me get a better understanding of how to tailor designs to the needs of the user, particularly through use of information architecture.
