            <h1 class="title">About the Project</h1>
            <p>How often do you need to purchase a product as soon as possible, but are unsure where to buy it? Well, we set out to fix that problem with the 
                Buy & Borrow mobile app.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title-h2">The Idea</h2>
            <p>Buy & Borrow is a search tool that allows users to save time and proactively support their local community. The app gives users instant access to 
                product information such as price, stock levels and directions, all toward saving the user as much time as possible. Users can also borrow items from members 
                of their local community in an effort to raise community spirit, and drive down user spending.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title-h2">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>There is challenge in creating an app that has substantial value for users to be their main source for quick information over search tools such as 
                Google.

            <h1>Our Methodology</h1>
            <p>
                This project was the first major UX project for all of our team and we aimed to complete the project with strict methodlogy, as to not 
                get carried away with large scope. We began with research, making sure that we had enough feedback to validate our ideas. Through defining and 
                ideating, we nailed down our app structure and were ready to move into wireframing and prototyping. The goal of our methodology was to make sure 
                we covered all bases through the journey, and that started with out initial proto persona.
                 <br><br>

            <h2>Proto Persona</h2>
            <p>
                Creating our proto persona Mandy was crucial to beginning our journey through our methodology. After brainstorming, the group came to the conclusion 
                that people are looking to save time in their daily lives and would prosper if there was a tool availble to show them the closest location to buy their needed 
                items. This persona reflected (in our opinion) the average user for our app idea. 
                <br><Br>
                Mandy is a 35 year old occupations manager who is budget conscious, spontaneous and friendly. She doesn't like to waste money or time, and gains enjoyment when 
                supporting local business. She enjoys meeting new people, and is very talkative. If provided with our app idea, we believe Mandy would save time and money while also 
                being able to support her local community and meet new people.

            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <p>As a user research team, we wanted to understand the way users access product information when in need, and the pain points that come with it. In the modern world, people 
                are living busy lives and are looking for more effiency. In an age fuled by online shopping, our team is looking to drive interest in local business by creating a platform 
                that gives people quick and reliable information about where they can buy their needed items close to their home. 
                <br><br>
                The ideal participant for our testing would be living a busy lifestyle, leaving them poor on time. These participants would participate in in-store and 
                online shopping regularly, and have experience accessing information for their desired items online.
                <br><br>
                We ran five user tests.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Research Questions</h2>
            <p> 1. What does our user look like? <br>
                2. What is the <b>process</b> a user usually takes when looking to purchase a product?<br>
                3. What <b>challenges</b> do people face when trying to source/purchase needed products?<br>
                4. How can we <b>encourage</b> people to shop locally?<br>
                5. Have people's views on shopping for products changed post-pandemic?

            <h2>Interview Findings</h2>
            <p>Our typical user is very <b>time poor</b>. Users want to be able to search for, and compare items before travelling to the store to purchase them. A major furstration for users 
                is <b>not being able to find accurate stock information</b>. While users want to support local business they often do not know where they are located or what products they have to 
                offer. Users were adament that they value in-store shopping now more than ever after the pandemic. We felt validated in our proto persona assumptions, while also gaining a lot of great 
                insight into shopping pain points and what kind of information users value when shopping.

            <h1>User Persona</h1>
            <p>After our user interviews we used our data to complete this user persona. Olivia is a online school teacher, who juggles her time with being a mother 
                to 3 children. She is certainly poor on time, and values her time management more than anything. She tries to keep up a good social life, which gives her 
                incentive to shop locally and meet people in her community. Unfortunetely, she is finding it hard to meet new people post pandemic. 
                <br><br>
                When searching for products, Olivia values quick and accurate information. She enjoys seeing the local economy thrive and it motivated to contribute when she can.
                <br><br>
                We believe our app idea will help Olivia which her budgetary concerns, help her manage her time efficiently, and provide her means to meeting, and supporting her local community.

            <h1>Key User Insights</h1>
            <p>During our research we discovered that due to the pandemic and 
                the resulting supply chain shortages many consumers are now
                struggling to find which stores stock the products that they need.
                <Br><Br>
                Therefore, we believe that giving accurate stock information might 
                be able to help consumers if we present that information clearly.
                <br><br>
                We might do this by providing real tiem stock level to our users, 
                and giving them options to sort by distance. Doing this will allow our 
                pdocut to save time and energy for our users and their busy schedules.

            <h3>
                Based on these key user insights, we arrived at this problem statement:

                Olvia needs a covenient, reliable and accurate way to locate and compare 
                items she is looking to purchase so that she can feel satisfied with her 
                purchasing decision, and spend her limited free time on the more important

            <h1>Ideation</h1>
            <p>We used a combination of brainstorming, competitor analysis and feature prioritisation methods 
                to determine which app features would be best implemented in order to solve the problems highlighted 
                by our user research.

            <p>Our <b>Competitor Analysis</b> showed that many sights included quick buying options for consumers looking for easy access

        <div class="ideation-3">
            <p>We felt it was important to understand which features would create an impactful experience for the user, so we created this <b>Feature Prioritisation</b> 
                matrix. This project was completed in a 3 week time period, so the team was challenged to manage the scope of the project and understand what the essential 
                features required for our solution really were.
                <br><br>
                We belived that key features to focus on would be making sure the app helps users find products <b>efficiently</b> and make sure they user will know 
                the exact route and location of the desired item, leading to more chances to support local businesses.
                <br><br>
                Using our key user insights and coming out of the ideation phase with a real sense of discovery, the team created this <b>user journey map</b> to display the users 
                path to app discovery, and then showccase how to app will aid the user in the situation. 
                <br><br>
                In the scenario, Olivia is planning a family holiday that requires some extra shopping for essential items needed for the trip. Using the mobile app, Olivia 
                searches for her desired items and using the app, finds the information she needs and confirms the fastest route to get her shopping done so she can get back to her 
                busy life.

            <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
            <p>When planning our information architecture, we harkened back to our key users insights and remembered that users were looking to save time and energy to focus on the 
                more important aspects of their lives. In regards to that insight, we created a <b>user flow</b> that ensured users would be taking minimal steps after opening the app 
                to gain the information they need.
                <br><br>
                The user flow is split into three sections: buy, my lists and borrow. The 'buy' user journey relates to customers searching for products, and discovering the necesarry information 
                they need. From there, they can add items to create shopping lists for future need, thus saving even more time. Lastly, users are able to 'borrow' items from other members of their local 
                community by seeing location results of community members willing to help out.

                Our low-fidelity wireframes helped us entertain our ideas and see the them in action, while also grounding us and helping us learn what worked, and what didn't. This prototype was key for 
                upcoming user testing sessions, where we would look to understand any outstanding user pain points.

                Our main goal for this round of testing was to determine if the key features of the app added value in their current state, and identify through questioning what users felt worked and didn't work so 
                far.
                <br><br>
                User tests highlighted serveral features of the app that could potentially be improved. Due to time contraints, it was impractical to complete all of these. We decided as a team to collate this

            <h2>High-Fidelity Screens</h2>
            <p>
                After our prototype testing, and calling back to our user research and key insights, we designed the high-fidelity prototype for the Buy & Borrow mobile app.
            </p>
            <div class="hifi-image"></div>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h3>The Home Screen</h3>
            <p>
                As we found out during testing, the home screen was the key for user guidance inside our solution. Our inital wireframes showed a map across the home screen, so users 
                could find locations instantly. This ended up being too jarring for users during testing, who did not understand where to go when arriving. This variation of the home screen 
                provides users with a recognisable search bar, distance slider, and easy to understand links at the bottom of the screen.
            <div class="training-image"></div>
            <h3>Generated Map Routes</h3>
            <p>
                Here you can see an example of a multi-item route being generated by a user. We aimed to give users instant feedback of location information for items they needed, so this can represent 
                an example of giving users a shopping route, and also keeping track of their progress.
            </p>
            <div class="calendar-image"></div>
            <h3>Create a Shopping List</h3>
            <p>
                To maximise user experience and time saving, we created a shopping list function so users could easily come back to items they need on a regular basis. There is an option to generate 
                a shopping route from the list function, giving users the ability to save time and energy recreating their list from scratch each time.
            </p>
            <div class="connect-image"></div>
            <h3>Borrow from the Community</h3>
            <p>
                Users are able to borrow items from local community members, saving money and meeting new people in the process. Users indicated a desire to be more involved in their local community during user testing. 
                There is also an option to lend items, if users so desire.
            </p>
            <div class="visit-image"></div>
            <h3>Chat and Organise</h3>
            <p>
                Lastly, users are able to create a profile within the app and use a chat function to speak with potential borrowers or lenders from the local community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being the first project on my UX/UI journey it was an extremely important learning experience. Creating and bring ideas to the table alongisde other designers in a rewarding experience, and also 
                a challenge. Everyone is excited to bring their best work forward, but at the end of the day it is about having trust in your teammates, and great communication to keep the lines open and work through any 
                issues together. 
                <br><Br>
                It was an important learning oppurtunity during this projects middle portion where we struggled to understand our own idea. We cornered ourselves with a great deal of scope, and did not have the experience to 
                make the tough decisions on what features to keep, and which to put to the side. Fortunately, we came together strongly as a team and made a plan for the last act of the project and produced work we are all 
                very proud of.
