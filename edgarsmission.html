            <h1 class="title">About the Project</h1>
            <p>Edgar's Mission is an Australian non-for-profit organisation that provides care to over 400 rescued farm 
                animals. The goal of this project was to improve the digital presence of the redesign, resulting in higher 
                donation, volunteering, and visitation rates.</p>
            <h2 class="title-h2">The Idea</h2>
            <p>Our idea was to combine all organisation's moving pieces into to one home. We wanted to create a hub 
                people to view all possible options when interacting with the mission. while hopefully creating further 
                reason for users to help the mission in any way they can.</p>
            <h2 class="title-h2">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The current website featured many branching paths that linked to external websites for things such as the
                shop and a donation portal. The challenge was to bring all avenues together seamlessly to create one 
                website that felt connected in every way,</p>
