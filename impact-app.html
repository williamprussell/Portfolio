            <h1>About the Project
            </h1>
            <p>The Impact App is the culmniation of various brainstorming sessions, ideation, research, and 
                iterations. The goal of this project was to perform a redesign for the 300 Blankets website, a non-for-profit 
                cause in Melbourne, Australia, improving awareness and engagement with the cause in the process.</p>
            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>Our idea was to create a platform where users could not only register to engage with the cause 
                through volunteering, but also learn essential skills, and connect with new people.
            </p>
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The current 300 Blankets web presence showed no signs of direction to the user, and lacked resources for 
                information and steps to take to help. The challenge was present relevant information to the user in a way 
                that made sense, while also rebranding the 300 Blankets with a new, fresh style that would draw in more users.
            </p>

            <h1>Our Methodology</h1>
            <p>Beginning with brainstorming, the group spoke about various issues that they felt passionately 
                about, and chose homelessness as it felt relevant to Melbourne. Upon researching local causes, we 
                came across 300 Blankets, a local non-for-profit that is dedicated to supporting people experiencing, or at risk 
                of homelessness in Victoria. From here, we determined our methodology for the project, and got to work. <br><br>

            <h2>Proto Persona</h2>
            <p>Our intital proto persona, Gabriel, was a 35 year old salesperson, who cares about his local 
                community. Gabriel likes to give back to his community, but sometimes feels unsure about how to 
                get involved. He would love to connect with friends and others during this venture.

    <section id="grid">
        <div class="research-content">
            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <p>We set out to run user testing, hoping to gain some clarity on our proto persona, and also gain some 
                valuable insight into our potential users and their pain points.<Br><br>
                
                Our ideal research participant would have a keen interest in helping non-for-profit causes in various ways 
                (volunteering, donating). The participant would have a good understanding of what a non-for-profit is, and have 
                some experience engaging with them.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Research Questions</h2>
            <p> 1. What does our user look like? <br>
                2. What can <b>motivate</b> someone to engage with a cause they believe in?<br>
                3. How <b>aware</b> are people of non-for-profit organisations?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- What will assist in bringing greater awareness? <br>
                4. Do you <b>engage</b> with non-for-profit causes?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- If so, in what ways?<br>
                5. How aware is the user of homelessness rates in Australia?<br>
                6. In what ways can homelessness be helped?

        <div class="interview-content">
            <h2>Interview Findings</h2>
            <p>While our users are aware of non-for-profits and their impact, they are largely unaware at not only 
                the correct way to engage directly with them, but also what to do if they are volunteering. All users 
                believe that awareness for non-for-profits can be improved through use of marketing and social media. <br><br>

                Users would be interested in volunteering, but are more likely to get involved because of time restraints. Users 
                believe if there was more information on how to, and when to volunteer they would be more likely to engage.<br><br>

                Users are looking for connections, and would be more obligated to engage with a non-for-profit if they were better 
                connected to the community.

    <section id="grid">
        <div class="persona-content">
            <h1>User Persona</h1>
            <p>After our user interviews, we completed an affinity chart and an empathy map on the way to creating this user persona. 
                Gabriel is looking for the chance to learn and connect with like-minded people, and gains happiness from contributing 
                positively to the community. Unfortunetely, he finds it hard to find time to be more engaged, and feels unaware about 
                how to be involved. <br><br>
                
                Once we created this user persona, we established that our user is certainly motivated to help his community, but needs 
                to feel like he has a good understanding of what is needed of him, and when he is needed.

            <h1>Key User Insights</h1>
            <p>"I am aware of the issue of homelessness and would like to get involved to make a difference in people's lives, but it's 
                not always clear to me on how I can help people in need".<br><br>
                
                "I admire the work that Non-for-Profit organisations do and their positive impact to the community, but it seems to me 
                like they have everything organised already and I don't know how to contribute".<Br><br>

                "I think connecting with others is a great idea, but I would need to learn ways on how to communicate effectively 
                with people before I feel confident to approach anyone on the streets".<br><br>

                "Having empathy and being aware of your surroundings is the most important starting point when deciding to help, but I 
                also fear that more funding is needed to make real change".

            <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>After creating our user persona, and determining our key user insights, we established this problem statement to guide us 
                towards our goal:
            </p>
            <h3>300 blankets is a Not-for-profit organisation that aims to provide blankets, food and help to people experiencing or being at risk of homelessness.
                <br><br>
                Through user interviews we have discovered that people would genuinely like to help others and get involved in volunteering, but are uncertain and 
                lack confidence and time in approaching the people facing homelessness.
                <br><br>
                How might we raise awareness of the issue of homelessness, educate people on communication and engagement skills, and make it easy for people to get 
                involved?

            <p>Driven towards sketching and wireframing, we started ideating to determine our best course of action going forward and understand the value of our product.

                We began with a <b>competitor analysis</b>.
                <br><br>
                Through our competitor analysis of related NFP websites, we found that many did not feature easily available and clear information about their cause, 
                or how to volunteer and be involved..
