            <h1>About the Project
            </h1>
            <p>The Impact App is the culmination of various brainstorming sessions, ideation, research and 
                iterations. The goal of this project was to perform a redesign for the 300 Blankets website, a non-for-profit 
                cause in Melbourne, Australia, improving awareness and engagement with the cause in the process.</p>
            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>Our idea was to create a platform where users could not only register to engage with the cause 
                through volunteering, but also learn essential skills and connect with new people.
            </p>
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The current 300 Blankets website showed no signs of direction to the user and lacked resources for 
                information and steps to take for help. The challenge was present relevant information to the user in a way 
                that made sense, while also rebranding the 300 Blankets website with a new, refreshed style that would draw in more users.
            </p>
            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Figma, Github, Miro, Visual Studio Code</p>
            <h2>Project Length</h2>
            <p>3 weeks</p>
            <h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>

            <h1>Our Methodology</h1>
            <p>Beginning with brainstorming, the group spoke about various issues that they felt passionately 
                about, before choosing homelessness as it felt relevant to Melbourne. Upon researching local causes, we 
                came across 300 Blankets, a local non-for-profit that is dedicated to supporting people experiencing, or at risk 
                of homelessness in Victoria. From here, we determined our methodology for the project, and got to work. <br><br>

            <h2>Proto Persona</h2>
            <p>Our intitial proto persona, Gabriel, was a 35 year old salesperson who cares about his local 
                community. Gabriel likes to give back to his community, but sometimes feels unsure about how to 
                get involved. He would love to connect with friends and others during this venture.

        <div class="research-content">
            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <p>We set out to run user testing, hoping to gain some clarity on our proto persona and also gain some 
                valuable insight into our potential users and their pain points.<Br><br>
                
                Our ideal research participant would have a keen interest in helping non-for-profit causes in various ways 
                (volunteering, donating). The participant would have a good understanding of what a non-for-profit is and have 
                some experience engaging with them.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Research Questions</h2>
            <p> 1. What does our user look like? <br>
                2. What can <b>motivate</b> someone to engage with a cause they believe in?<br>
                3. How <b>aware</b> are people of non-for-profit organisations?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- What will assist in bringing greater awareness? <br>
                4. Do you <b>engage</b> with non-for-profit causes?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- If so, in what ways?<br>
                5. How aware is the user of homelessness rates in Australia?<br>
                6. In what ways can homelessness be helped?

            <h2>Interview Findings</h2>
            <p>While our users are aware of non-for-profits and their impact, they are largely unaware at not only 
                the correct way to engage directly with them, but also what to do if they are volunteering. All users 
                believe that awareness for non-for-profits can be improved through use of marketing and social media. <br><br>

                Users would be interested in volunteering, but are more likely to get involved because of time restraints. Users 
                believe if there was more information on how and when to volunteer they would be more likely to engage.<br><br>

                Users are looking for connections, and would be more obligated to engage with a non-for-profit if they were better 
                connected to the community.

            <h1>User Persona</h1>
            <p>After our user interviews, we completed an affinity chart and an empathy map on the way to creating this user persona. 
                Gabriel is looking for the chance to learn and connect with like-minded people, and gains happiness from contributing 
                positively to the community. Unfortunately, he finds it hard to find time to be more engaged, and feels unaware about 
                how to be involved. <br><br>
                
                Once we created this user persona, we established that our user is certainly motivated to help his community, but needs 
                to feel like he has a good understanding of what is needed of him, and when he is needed.

                "I admire the work that non-for-profit organisations do and their positive impact to the community, but it seems to me

                "I think connecting with others is a great idea, but I would need to learn ways of how to communicate effectively 
                with people before I feel confident to approach anyone on the streets."<br><br>

                "Having empathy and being aware of your surroundings is the most important starting point when deciding to help, but I

            </p>
            <h3>300 Blankets is a not-for-profit organisation that aims to provide blankets, food and help to people experiencing, or being at risk of, homelessness.
                <br><br>
                Through user interviews we have discovered that people would genuinely like to help others and get involved in volunteering, but are uncertain and 
                lack confidence and time in approaching the people facing homelessness.
                <br><br>
                How might we raise awareness of the issue of homelessness, educate people on communication and engagement skills, and make it easy for people to get 
                involved?

        <div class="ideation-1">
            <h1>Ideation</h1>
            <p>Driven towards sketching and wireframing, we started ideating to determine our best course of action going forward and understand the value of our product.
                <br><br>
                We began with a <b>Competitor Analysis</b>.
                <br><br>
                Through our competitor analysis of related non-for-profit websites, we found that many did not feature easily available and clear information about their cause, 
                or how to volunteer and get involved.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="comp-analysis"></div>
        <div class="ideation-2">
            <p>We next tackled <b>Feature Prioritisation</b>, using a brainstorming sessions ('I like', 'I wish', 'What if') to determine key features for 
                our users.<Br><br>
                Key features we chose to focus on, based on their priority and overall effort, were connecting with friends and others, skills assessment, 
                raising awareness and rewarding users for their efforts.           
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-prior"></div>
        <div class="ideation-3">
            <p>
                By understanding which features to prioritise and having gained our key user insights, we created this <b>Value Proposition Canvas</b>.
                <br><br>
                It features the products provided by 300 Blankets, and gives substance to what helps create user gains and pain points.
                <br><br>
                This is a key part of the story of our product.

        <div class="value-proposition"></div>
        <div class="ideation-4">
            <p>
                Finally, this <b>Storyboard</b> was created to showcase our user's journey to using the product, providing key motivations and context.
                <br><br>
                In this story, Gabriel feels compelled to help in his local community after seeing first hand the homelessness issues currently present, but he 
                is unsure how to best proceed. 
                <br><br>
                He finds the 300 Blankets website, and is pointed towards the Impact App where he can not only register to volunteer, but also learn important 
                techniques on how to act and engage while trying to help.
                <br><br>
                He attends an event and uses his newly found skills to help, making new connections in the process.

            <h1>The Solution</h1>
            <p>
                After our ideation phase, we came to the conclusion that a <b>mobile app</b> would be the most viable solution for the user pain points 
                established during our research phase. This is because:
                <br><br>
                1. Our users are time poor and would benefit from using their smart device for quick and easy access.
                <br><br>
                2. Users are accustomed to using mobile apps and would be able to navigate the app interface with relative ease.
                <br><Br>
                3. Online connections with friends and others are carried out on mobile devices frequently in the modern age.
                <br><br>
                4. An app can be a great connecting tool for the 300 Blankets organisation, bringing in more engagement and awareness.
                <br><br>
                Alongside the Impact App, we decided to complete a front end development redesign of the 300 Blankets website, with the idea that the 
                website will directly call out to the mobile app, creating a multi-modal experience.

                basic functions and navigation of the app such as onboarding, registering for events, training, and using the chat function.

                to get a positive reaction for our first tests. Here is some of the important feedback we recieved:

            <p>
                Based on what we learned during our user testing while also reflecting on our user persona and key insights, we made alterations to the 
                low-fidelity screens and moved ahead with the high-fidelity phase. Our goals for this phase were to bring our product to life with visual 
                flair, as well as improve upon the testing results and create a product that serves all of our users' needs.
            </p>
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Our style guide came together across the three weeks of the project and focused on colours inspired by a blanket. Of course, this reflects 
                on the 300 Blankets organisation and their initiative to provide blankets to those in need. While the primary colour scheme was bold, we chose to use 
                lighter version of these colours for the application, providing a softer viewing experience for those using the app frequently.
                <br><br>
                The Impact logo was designed to portray a fun and engaging character, while feeling bold and determined.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>
                We designed a feature where users can learn essential skills for volunteering, such as active listening, awareness, and more. This feauture was chosen to 
                directly aid users with pain points releting to lack of awareness and skills. Users complete training modules to gain knowledge, then take a quiz to earn their 
                completion badge.
            </p>
            <div class="training-image"></div>
            <h3>Volunteer Calendar</h3>
            <p>
                Users can use the in-app calendar function to register for events, check upcoming dates, invite connections, and more. This feature was integral to the design of the 
                app, as many users were not aware of upcoming events from the non-for-profit, and had limited time to commit to volunteering.
            </p>
            <div class="calendar-image"></div>
            <h3>Connect with Friends</h3>
            <p>
                During research, we discovered that users would be more likely to commit time to engaging with non-for-profits if they made connections 
                with like-minded people. As part of the Impact App design, we chose to build upon that idea with a friends & chat section, where users can connect 
                with those they meet on volunteering sessions, and chat with them about further events.

                This project was a fantastic learning experience for me and a fantastic culmination of all of the hard work put in throughout the 
                Monash University UX/UI Boot Camp over 7 months. Creating a multi-modal product was challenging, but rewarding. I learnt a lot about 
                project scope and how to manage your work load, especially with fixed time frames for completion. I learnt the importance of prioritising 
                features for the MVP, as many ideas were pushed aside during this project so we could nail the most important aspects that would benefit the user. 
                This project took plenty of teamwork, focus, determination, and resolve to complete, and I am very proud of the outcome for the entire group.
